# HR Analytics Platfrom | hr-analytics-platform

A collaborative web application developed by a team of students using agile methodology. 
The platform, targeted at small Singapore-based organisations, was finalised after undergoing multiple iterations of prototyping with thorough market research, as well as surveys, interviews and user testing with HR executives/leaders, managers in SMEs, and data scientists. 

## Objectives

  1) Prioritise ease-of-use, customisability, and speed.
  2) Generate visualisations from the selected four HR metrics â€“ Payments, Attrition, Skills, and Demographics.
  3) Form validation; Flag errors to the user in simple terms.
  4) Customisable visualisations with recommended graph types based on user's selected options.
  5) View raw data in a table and export to different file formats.
  6) Generate basic analysis with simple statistical techniques.
